        <p> A <b>lion</b> The lion (Panthera leo) is a species in the family Felidae and a member of the genus Panthera. It is most recognisable for its muscular, deep-chested body, short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions have a prominent mane. With a typical head-to-body length of 184–208 cm (72–82 in) they are larger than females at 160–184 cm (63–72 in). It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A lion pride consists of a few adult males, related females and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator, although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur, and have been known to hunt humans, although the species typically does not.

Typically, the lion inhabits grasslands and savannas, but is absent in dense forests. It is usually more diurnal than other big cats, but when persecuted it adapts to being active at night and at twilight. In the Pleistocene, the lion ranged throughout Eurasia, Africa and North America, but today it has been reduced to fragmented populations in sub-Saharan Africa and one critically endangered population in western India. It has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 1996 because populations in African countries have declined by about 43% since the early 1990s. Lion populations are untenable outside designated protected areas. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes for concern.

One of the most widely recognised animal symbols in human culture, the lion has been extensively depicted in sculptures and paintings, on national flags, and in contemporary films and literature. Lions have been kept in menageries since the time of the Roman Empire and have been a key species sought for exhibition in zoological gardens across the world since the late 18th century. Cultural depictions of lions were prominent in the Upper Paleolithic period; carvings and paintings from the Lascaux and Chauvet Caves in France have been dated to 17,000 years ago, and depictions have occurred in virtually all ancient and medieval cultures that coincided with the lion's former and current ranges.</p>

        <h3>My Essay</h3>
        <p>"1) LIONS ARE SOCIAL<br>
Of all the big cat species in the world, lions are the most social. They live together in large groups known as "prides". The size of a pride can range in size from 15 to 40 members. These prides include multiple adult males, a dozen or more related females and the pride's cubs. In general, the more members a pride has, the stronger it is relative to rival prides. The pride’s females also prefer to have more males in the pride as this helps to ensure the survival of their cubs.</p>

<p>2) FEMALE LIONS DO MOST OF THE HUNTING, WHILE MALES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PROTECTING THE PRIDE.<br>
Male lions may get all of the attention with their majestic manes, but the females do the majority of the work when it comes to hunting. Anywhere from 85-90% of the hunting is done by the females in a given pride. The males, meanwhile, protect both the pride and the pride's territory (which can extend up to 100 square miles) from rival prides and other predators. Even though females do the vast majority of the hunting, male lions usually get to eat first!A lion shows of its claws

<p>3) LIONS DO NOT NEED TO DRINK EVERYDAY, BUT THEY DO NEED TO EAT.,<br>Lions can go up to four days without drinking water, but they need to eat everyday. Adult female lions need to eat about 11 pounds of meat each day, while adult males eat 16 pounds or more every day. And while lions primarily prey on large herbivores such as zebra, wildebeest and buffalo, they have been known to prey on smaller animals as well.</p>

<p>4) LIONS ARE FANTASTIC HUNTERS,<br>
A lion has many physical characteristics that make it a superb hunter. The vision of a lion, for example, is roughly six times more sensitive to light than a human's. This gives lions a distinct advantage when hunting at night. A lion's claws are retractable, allowing for the excellent control when it needs to go in for a kill.<br>
Did we mention that those claws are large? When fully extended, a lion's claws can be up to 1 1/2 inches in length. Lions can also reach speeds of up to 50 miles per hour in short bursts and jump up to 36 feet in length. Taken together, it's easy to see why the lion is referred to as the "king of the jungle", which leads us to our next fact</p>

<p>5) LIONS DO NOT LIVE IN JUNGLES
Known colloquially as the "king of the jungle", lions do not actually live in jungles. Instead, their primary habitats consist of Africa’s grasslands and plains.</p>

<p>6) LIONS COMMUNICATE IN MANY WAYS
A lion's roar can be heard up to 5 miles away. The roar is a warning to other animals and rival prides to stay clear of the lion's domain. But beyond the iconic roar, lions communicate with one another as many cats do: through mews and purrs.<br>

Lions also rub their heads on one another as an act of bonding and to spread the "family scent". This scent allows the lions of a specific pride to know who is a member of their family and who is not if a dispute arises between prides.</p>

<p>7) FEMALE LIONS RAISE CUBS TOGETHER
Lions mate every two years and female lions give birth to a litter of 2-3 cubs after a four-month pregnancy. Females in the same pride tend to give birth around the same time, which allows multiple litters to be raised together.<br>

This has the added advantage of allowing different cubs to nurse with other lion mothers, making it easier for the pride to manage the cubs in those crucial early months. Where's dad during the raising of the cubs? Alas, male lions do not directly participate in the parenting, but they will protect the pride's cubs from danger.

<p>8) LION CUBS HAVE TWO OTHER NAMES
Though they are usually referred to as "cubs", lion babies have two other names: "whelps" and "lionets".</p>

<p>9) LIONS ARE THE SECOND LARGEST CAT ON EARTH
After tigers, lions are the largest wild cats on the planet. Male lions can grow up to 10 feet in length and weigh up to 550 pounds, while female lions can grow to a length of 9 feet and weigh up to 395 pounds.</p>
