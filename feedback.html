	<h1>how did i feel about this coding lesson<h1><br>

<p>I really apreciatete it, it has thaught me alot i cannot wait to use it the next time when i grow up. ithink it will really help me in the future.</p><br>

<p>if i had a choice i would rate this class 10/10 i have alot of words to describe this class i cannot just pick one! i just hopr that my coding will improve and i can remember everything or this will be a big waste of money.</p><br>

<p> But i do still wish we could meet each oyher in real life and not do it onine!</p>
